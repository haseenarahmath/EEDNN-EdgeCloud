## Demo Video

Experience how **EEDNN-EdgeCloud** enables adaptive inference across edge and cloud environments — combining real-time image recognition, early-exit control, and performance visualization.
The video demonstrates how users can:

* Upload images and view **exit-wise predictions** and confidence levels
* Dynamically adjust **thresholds and branch depths** to explore accuracy–latency trade-offs
* Compare **training strategies** and inference behaviors through **interactive charts** powered by *Chart.js* and *D3.js*

## Overview
This system demonstrates how **early-exit policies** balance *accuracy* and *latency* in deep neural networks.  
It provides a **Flask-based edge–cloud architecture** where users can upload images, visualize per-exit predictions, and analyze performance under different thresholds or training strategies.

---

## Key Features
- **Unified Flask Application:** Launch directly using `edgeWebAPI.py` — configuration handled automatically via `config.py`.  
- **Edge–Cloud Integration:** Runs edge and cloud inference nodes through REST endpoints.  
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Explore the model behavior live — upload an image and instantly view predictions, confidence, and latency at each exit. Use dropdowns to dynamically change confidence thresholds, branch counts, datasets, and training strategies, and watch the charts update in real time to reveal accuracy–latency trade-offs.
- **Inference Analysis :** Explore threshold  trade-offs for accuracy vs. inference time.  
- **Training Strategy Explorer:** Compare Base, Joint, Layered, and Separate training performance.  
- **Built-in Configuration:** All URLs, ports, dataset paths, and model settings are defined in `config.py`.  
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Interactive analytics powered by **Chart.js** and **D3.js**.

## Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EEDNN-EdgeCloud.git
cd EEDNN-EdgeCloud
````

### 2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Flask application

Simply execute:

```bash
python edgeWebAPI.py
```

All host, port, and path settings are loaded automatically from **`config.py`**.

By default, the app runs on:
👉 **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**

(If you also wish to start the cloud node, run the equivalent file for cloud setup.)
